# Learn SASS

This is a simple repository for learning SASS.

You can see how SASS works on [their website](https://sass-lang.com/) or through any crash course on Youtube. I recommend [Brad Traversy's Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nu5mdN2JIwM) or [Dev Ed's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz6eOVaaelI).

## How to run this repository

1. Please install Node JS version 14 (or the LTS version) first (https://nodejs.org/en/download).

3. Open the repository folder on your text editor (Visual Studio Code, for example)
