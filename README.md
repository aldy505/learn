# My learning dumpster

Before this repository, there was a lot of `learn-x` repository of mine, along the way, it's gotten out of hand on my local machine, so I declutter everything up a bit.

Here is the place where you can see how dumb I actually am. Not trying to prove a point or anything, but at somepoint of our lives, we all need to learn something, a few months later,
we need to stop whatever we're doing and re-learn everything again.

Stuff's changing.

  <summary>If you're not interested a bit of my life story, you should continue browse Github or do something else. This would waste your time a bit.</summary>
  I began my journey on computer-related stuffs when I was like 12 or 13 years old. At that time, I originally was playing around with HTML, CSS, and some Wordpress, really.
  Later, I began interested on web development. Then, I learn PHP where namespace isn't really familiar and object-oriented was a thing.

  It got me down to a rabbit hole of knowing people who are like 20-30 years old (keep in mind, I was 12-13 back then), knowing how is it to live a life on college,
  code some more. Even frameworks wasn't a thing back then.

  Here I am, in 2021, nearly 10 years apart from that point in time. Stuff's changing so fast, I used to code in solely PHP & HTML with MySQL as a database.
  Now there's more technology for web development. I don't even know you could use C for creating a back end.

  It's been nearly 2 years since late 2019 where I continue where I left off, started to learn PHP with frameworks again (it was Laravel, Lumen, and Slim). Began interested on
  learning Node.js (keep in mind, on 2012, no one likes Javascript, we all rely on JQuery for that part) and helped some open source project with it.

  Now that I've learned Go, I began to went deeper to the rabbit hole of tech stuffs, programming languages, and the local (and worldwide) community.

  It's tiring, but it's a good fun.
