# Learn Julia

Julia is basically a language meant for scientific computing. So, something like data analysis, heavy calculation, and other stuffs related to that. But the library itself is pretty general, you have C language support, HTTP, and some other stuffs.

What interest me about Julia is that it's a easily readable language, fast, and I don't know, I just feel like it. Although it's not really a general purpose programming language, it'll be a fun language to learn.

The only problem with it is that there's not enough resources to learn.

A few resources:

* [Julia Website](https://julialang.org/)
* [Julia Documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/)
* [Learn Julia in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/julia/)
