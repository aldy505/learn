# Struct & Interface

I created this repository so I can understand the difference between struct and interface, and how about implementing them.

I STILL DON'T GET IT???

## How to run this

```bash
$ go run struct.go
# Pet struct:  { Cat Jimmy 3 Black}
# Jason struct:  {Jason Statham 30 Non-Binary US}
# Jimmy is Jason Statham's pet.

$ go run interface.go
# August struct:  {Dog August 1 Beige}
# Alex struct:  {Alex Ferguson 25 Male UK}
# August is Alex Ferguson's pet
```
