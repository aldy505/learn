# Learn Go

This is a repository NOT for the purpose of me teaching other people how to learn Go.

This is just me, trying to learn and graps the things Go has to offer.

If you still want to read all through the codes, it's fine. There should be a bit of commentary on my thought process and what I am doing on that particular line of code.

Thank you for being here.
