# Nuxt Vuex Auth
This is **not** a module, dependency, or a boilerplate. This is meant for me to learn how you can create good auth system through Nuxt and Vuex. The backend is provided through server middleware with Express.

Please make sure that localhost port 3000 is available, if not, you will mess the axios calls. Thank you.

Any feedback for cleaner code will be appreciated, please put it directly through Issues.

  

## Build Setup
```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
